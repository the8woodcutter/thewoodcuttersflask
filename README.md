## Wed, Sugust 28th 2024:
####: This new copy of mr. the8woodcutter.sh here will be morphed into a flask based blog.
  - I found that when building musicplace.vip (flask app) which I was learning flask framework it was easyand quick.
  - I had a kinda a dickhead but cool cat nevertheless mentor for some time over skype, Sam Claughan, he's a long time web developer and e helped me learn Laravel framework some years ago.
  - I capitalized on previous web app framework experience and made quicd to share a listen of my best on thos anet fkn hardcore rave music.  As well as occasional dub bass.
  - This project won't require planning.  I guess just make a few views, a couple one or two CRUD flows and views for them, import and/or convert existing posts and then this app will fi ally have a cozy chair to sit in and build into my own web log (possible resume one day).
  - This is my WEB ART BLOG.  Version 2.0
