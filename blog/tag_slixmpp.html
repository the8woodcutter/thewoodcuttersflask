Greetings internet!  I thought I would explain about some of the updates I've done to my XMPP chat bot <code>mrBot</code>.  It's funny, at one time <code>mrBot</code> was probably more famous than I am in XMPP world.  In case you <b>still</b> don't know what XMPP is, that I continuously refer to, allow me to explain shortly:
<br/><br/>
XMPP (eXtensible messaging and presence protocol) is not a web program, persay, as the "web" runs primarily as websites using <code>HTTP</code> on ports <code>80,443</code> in the internet network among the world.  So websites are the "web" and this is a chat protocol that is open source, fully open and standardized, and has matured over 22 years since the days of yahoo messenger, icq, aim, aol, etceter, those 90s chat programs you used to have to chat with people from around the world.  Well, all of those are dead, except for XMPP and IRC, which in my humble opinion will <b>never</b> die.  IRC (internet relay chat) has been around quite a lot longer than XMPP however THE CLOSEST thing to IRC that exists today is XMPP and XMPP is extensible beyond comprehension.  It has what are called <code>XEP</code> sub protocols for features used within the XMPP master protocol and can do things that IRC typically can't or won't do, or not typically, like HTTP file uploads, publish subscribe (pubsub) services for infinite blogging, status, real time syndication type of stuff.  If you've ever used Discord (gross) then you are aware that you can see your mates' status lines (under their name), whether they're online (green), away (orange), or invisible, etcetera, this is called "presence" and XMPP pioneered it FIRST.
<br/><br/>
One of the common things about open source stuff, especially as massive as XMPP as a protocol and a realm in which folks have build many many open source projects for use of it, is that rich fucks like Google and Facebook (yes, both have and did) have used the XMPP protocol for their google chat, facebook messenger, and once upon a time not too long ago you could actually connect to their networks using XMPP but not anymore!  Embrace, extend, extinguish, was their intentions.  Fail.  The awesome thing I love about XMPP is that <cod>A:</code> you can host your own instance, on your own domain, quite easily with a bit of linux skills, <code>B:</code> the entire scene is federated, just like email.  You have what's called a JID (jabber ID, because XMPP was originally called Jabber) which is simply a username@domain and unlike IRC, and some other platforms, that are newer and far inferior, you can TOTALLY expect to get access to the entire federated public realm of chats.  However there's a great many security features as well, and instance operators can choose to make their MUCs (multi user chats) private, moderated (require voice to chat), members only, and even enable E2EE (end to end encryption) in group chats.  So it's pretty covert if you want it to considering putting your instance on the tor or the i2p network.
<br/><br/>
Yes XMPP is fully open and public and it's beyond comprehension how extensible it is, and if you get to know the folks on there you can get to know how to make the most of XMPP.  A lot of folks become rather interested in computing, linux and self hosting services on linux servers.  A perfect place for me.
<br/><br/>
So I've made a bot, I started building <code>mrBot</code> about 2 years ago with the <a href="https://errbot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">ErrBot</a> multi protocol chat bot framework but I was dissatisfied with the errors and the bugs.  I eventually went with <a href="https://slixmpp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">SliXMPP</a> which is a mere library fully suited for XMPP bot building, among other amazing things.  This has enabled me to grow my python skills a lot!
<br/><br/>
So what I am happy about today is that I have polished up some bugs with <code>mrBot</code>.  Namely his awesomes function where he can accept a count, positive or negative, for any string almost.  I also finished rebuilding some functions that I had him doing when I was using ErrBot like the rolling of dice.  When you write "Roll 55" for example he'll output this:
<br/><br/>
<code>⚂ ⚁ ⚄ ⚂ ⚄ ⚅ ⚁ ⚅ ⚄ ⚁ ⚁ ⚄ ⚁ ⚀ ⚀ ⚅ ⚃ ⚀ ⚀ ⚅ ⚄ ⚀ ⚄ ⚁ ⚃ ⚅ ⚄ ⚂ ⚀ ⚅ ⚄ ⚁ ⚅ ⚀ ⚂ ⚁ ⚂ ⚂ ⚅ ⚁ ⚁ ⚃ ⚅ ⚄ ⚁ ⚄ ⚅ ⚀ ⚄ ⚁ ⚀ ⚁ ⚄ ⚅ ⚃</code>
<br/><br/>
A totally randomized dice for as many as you specify.  I realize it's kinda dumb, but it's entertaining to me, and <code>mrBot's</code> entire purpose is to teach me Python language.  Another thing I finished up was his "Food {food}" function where I've written pretty long lists for things you can "feed" <code>mrBot</code> and he'll have a cool answer to depending which category of lists you select what you guess for feeeding him.  Yea <code>mrBot</code> is kinda like my pet, in fact he's "my dog" and I do get pissed off when people kick him from the chats LoL...
<br/><br/>
SO aside from these obviously fully useless non-utility bot functions, tht are merely entertaining at most, I have finally done something, and begun to build actually useful bot functions for <code>mrBot</code>.  Namely network utilities.  Once in a while, like today for example, we'd be in a chat talking about how another operator has got a configuration issue where his server cannot reach mine, for example.  One of the common routines in this is some network command tools like ping, and some dns lookup tools, etc, that can help diagnose the network and come to a solution.  Well it's sure handy, if you think about it, to be able to search DNS records, with record types, and also to be able to ping with ipv4 and ipv6 another host, via a bot in that very chat, it makes things transparent and easily accessable.  So I've created today a <code>host</code>, a <code>ping</code> and a <code>ping6</code> tools for mrBot.  Tomorrow, if I'm feeling up to it I'd like to make the harder one which is the <code>dig</code> command so that that pretty much covers the basic most common tools for initial network probing.
<br/><br/>
I think, though honestly more like a really long time ago, this definitely permafries me as a NERD.  Ahahaha, which is awesome, cuz I love to do this stuff and it's functional uses are fun for the future too.  It's worth it to me to have spent numerous hours today to make this collection of bot upgrades, as I'm also expanding my python skills and learning new concepts and better use of the language and it's syntax ^^
<br/><br/>
A veteran web developer named Sam from Scotland, who somewhat mentored me a few years back over skype, taught me to have a practical use example for things you study if you're having a hard time understanding them.  You honestly can't just brute force learn stuff without such strategies, I'm serious.  You'll never get hands on experience.  This is how I've enjoyed over past years creating stuff, and then going slightly really astray and building my own custom stuff that impresses, all from learning.
<br/><br/>
That's enough rambling.  I had a certain long time friend in mind who I wanted to read my blog, I'm pretty sure he's not aware of it, he may not even be interested in it, but I had you in mind coatrack buddy for this cuz I think u'd be stoked.  <b>pEAcE</b> !

Greetings fellow netizons.  It is I, the woodcutter a.k.a. chunk from xmpp/irc.  I wanted to ramble a bit about what I've been working on with an awesome python library for making XMPP chat bots called <a href="https://slixmpp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html" target="_blank">SliXMPP</a>.  I have had for approximately two years now a bot of my own name <code>mrBot</code> and at one time he was more famous than I am in XMPP as everybody love him.  <code>mrBot</code> was my original python project for learning while exercising python and it started with errbot the multiprotocol bot framework actually.  It was a little bit too in depth and took me a long time to just get the configurations to work smoothly but then after not maintaining interest in it because of it's often bugs and inconsistencies I got slacking and bored of it.  What made me switch from this errbot project was that I was using a docker container, and this errbot can load in a list of MUCs or IRC channels so one docker container is good.  However that container was dated, as with most images on the docker hub, I eventually learned when in IRC a spammer had completely abused it inside out and the "ACL" or supposed access control list was null, it was configured and I swore it was fine, but worked not at all.  That was crappy.  So i ended up figuring out from a friend Shokara, who had the idea, was to use a biboumi transport, that can use IRC in XMPP client software, and so with XMPP ACL's working I could resume using <code>mrBot</code> in IRC but I lost a few benefits due to the nickname/JID translation.  Finally I was working on a cool plugin I called <code>err-megaphone</code> lol that <code>mrBot</code> would take from an admin only an argument, which is a message, after a command then send that whole argument to all the chats he is currently in.  So it could broadcast muc/channel wide whatever.  I thought this could have so much been so much fun to make and it was absolutely meant for XMPP, as <code>mrBot</code> lives in XMPP world, but I kept getting some dumb async error, and worked like an idiot for waaay waaay too long and gave up because errbot, I dunno, I don't think it's maintained by more than maybe one guy, and not maintained well I think.  It's however a multiprotocol bot program so it's huge.  I gave up and after about 3-6 more months passed and I decided that a library isn't going to hide from me so hard and get lost in object oriented programmiing aspects, in classes and namespaces and <b>aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</b> omg.
<br/><br/>
Holy moley was I correct.  SliXMPP is really not hard, it is no harder than errbot, in fact probably a fair bit easier and sooooo much simpler.  As well for learning Pythons, it's helped me boost my level in <code>/usr/bin/python3.10</code> a <b>LOT</b>.  However anytime you want to check out or use and modify the errbot plugins I made you're welcome to find them all on <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~cmdr_chunk" target="_blank">git.sr.ht/~cmdr_chunk</a>.  He had a food function, where chatters could feed him things, it had 4 lists of foods, for 4 response.  What I think made <code>mrBot</code> so awesome is the response I made for him to act like a dog because his avatar in XMPP is indeed a cute pixelate dog.  "My doggo" and when jan6 kicks him from #offtopic on ircnow I get on his case "you kicked my dogg, i keel you!  i will jump this fence and keel you and your family!" lmfao if you get the reference.
<br/><br/>
So in SliXMPP I've recreated and basically perfected a particular function that another popular IRC bot program called bitbot does.  I guess not so popular I cant find it's code on a web search, not the OFFICIAL code at least.  It's originally called "Karma" where if you quote somebody with a <code>++</code> to say nice work, or what have you, and likewise <code>--</code> in case they bad person or something.  I remade this SOOOOO much better.  I called it Awesomes.  Because it's not a person based thing, you can <code>++/--</code> any string you want using certain regex parsed characters under I think it's 22 characters or so.  As well not just at the beginning of the message on first character you start it, you can <code>++</code> a string like <code>pythons++</code> right here <code><<<</code> mid sentence and even <code>pythons++++++</code> again and it will catch them and increment / decrement the string for a saved count.  It uses shelve with python, it's new python3 shelve stuff that can REALLY easily save simple parameters to a database file and be modded and read again anytime later.  Anyhow, the awesomes function of <code>mrBot</code> does sooo much things better than bitbot and it's practical use case is fun and makes sense.  I've put a lot of work into it for my SliXMPP doghouse for <code>mrBot</code> and it's very well done.  Also I didn't mention that to use spaces instead of simply words space delimited you'd use "word"-- and even "word%%!"+++++++++++++++++++++++ and it parses correctly.  We've tested this function very much in IRC and good times ^^
<br/><br/>
I will tell of more <code>mrBot</code> tales another time folks, this has gotten long, come to XMPP or irc.ircnow.org and find me as <code>chunk</code>,<code>b0t</code>,<code>cmdr_coconut</code> or <code>cmdr_melon</code> on #offtopic, #armada, etcetera.  Bon Voyage!!
