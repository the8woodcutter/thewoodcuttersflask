Greetings fellow netizons.  It is I, the woodcutter a.k.a. chunk from xmpp/irc.  I wanted to ramble a bit about what I've been working on with an awesome python library for making XMPP chat bots called <a href="https://slixmpp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html" target="_blank">SliXMPP</a>.  I have had for approximately two years now a bot of my own name <code>mrBot</code> and at one time he was more famous than I am in XMPP as everybody love him.  <code>mrBot</code> was my original python project for learning while exercising python and it started with errbot the multiprotocol bot framework actually.  It was a little bit too in depth and took me a long time to just get the configurations to work smoothly but then after not maintaining interest in it because of it's often bugs and inconsistencies I got slacking and bored of it.  What made me switch from this errbot project was that I was using a docker container, and this errbot can load in a list of MUCs or IRC channels so one docker container is good.  However that container was dated, as with most images on the docker hub, I eventually learned when in IRC a spammer had completely abused it inside out and the "ACL" or supposed access control list was null, it was configured and I swore it was fine, but worked not at all.  That was crappy.  So i ended up figuring out from a friend Shokara, who had the idea, was to use a biboumi transport, that can use IRC in XMPP client software, and so with XMPP ACL's working I could resume using <code>mrBot</code> in IRC but I lost a few benefits due to the nickname/JID translation.  Finally I was working on a cool plugin I called <code>err-megaphone</code> lol that <code>mrBot</code> would take from an admin only an argument, which is a message, after a command then send that whole argument to all the chats he is currently in.  So it could broadcast muc/channel wide whatever.  I thought this could have so much been so much fun to make and it was absolutely meant for XMPP, as <code>mrBot</code> lives in XMPP world, but I kept getting some dumb async error, and worked like an idiot for waaay waaay too long and gave up because errbot, I dunno, I don't think it's maintained by more than maybe one guy, and not maintained well I think.  It's however a multiprotocol bot program so it's huge.  I gave up and after about 3-6 more months passed and I decided that a library isn't going to hide from me so hard and get lost in object oriented programmiing aspects, in classes and namespaces and <b>aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</b> omg.
<br/><br/>
Holy moley was I correct.  SliXMPP is really not hard, it is no harder than errbot, in fact probably a fair bit easier and sooooo much simpler.  As well for learning Pythons, it's helped me boost my level in <code>/usr/bin/python3.10</code> a <b>LOT</b>.  However anytime you want to check out or use and modify the errbot plugins I made you're welcome to find them all on <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~cmdr_chunk" target="_blank">git.sr.ht/~cmdr_chunk</a>.  He had a food function, where chatters could feed him things, it had 4 lists of foods, for 4 response.  What I think made <code>mrBot</code> so awesome is the response I made for him to act like a dog because his avatar in XMPP is indeed a cute pixelate dog.  "My doggo" and when jan6 kicks him from #offtopic on ircnow I get on his case "you kicked my dogg, i keel you!  i will jump this fence and keel you and your family!" lmfao if you get the reference.
<br/><br/>
So in SliXMPP I've recreated and basically perfected a particular function that another popular IRC bot program called bitbot does.  I guess not so popular I cant find it's code on a web search, not the OFFICIAL code at least.  It's originally called "Karma" where if you quote somebody with a <code>++</code> to say nice work, or what have you, and likewise <code>--</code> in case they bad person or something.  I remade this SOOOOO much better.  I called it Awesomes.  Because it's not a person based thing, you can <code>++/--</code> any string you want using certain regex parsed characters under I think it's 22 characters or so.  As well not just at the beginning of the message on first character you start it, you can <code>++</code> a string like <code>pythons++</code> right here <code><<<</code> mid sentence and even <code>pythons++++++</code> again and it will catch them and increment / decrement the string for a saved count.  It uses shelve with python, it's new python3 shelve stuff that can REALLY easily save simple parameters to a database file and be modded and read again anytime later.  Anyhow, the awesomes function of <code>mrBot</code> does sooo much things better than bitbot and it's practical use case is fun and makes sense.  I've put a lot of work into it for my SliXMPP doghouse for <code>mrBot</code> and it's very well done.  Also I didn't mention that to use spaces instead of simply words space delimited you'd use "word"-- and even "word%%!"+++++++++++++++++++++++ and it parses correctly.  We've tested this function very much in IRC and good times ^^
<br/><br/>
I will tell of more <code>mrBot</code> tales another time folks, this has gotten long, come to XMPP or irc.ircnow.org and find me as <code>chunk</code>,<code>b0t</code>,<code>cmdr_coconut</code> or <code>cmdr_melon</code> on #offtopic, #armada, etcetera.  Bon Voyage!!
