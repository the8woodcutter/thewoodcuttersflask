<b>Heya internet.  Whappens moew?</b><br/><br/>
<img src="/img/me.smmoke.w.specs.8.jpg" alt="I wear my sunglasses at winter..." /><br/><br/>
So this past 2 days has been gruelling, back breaking, barely withstandable labour to do a handful of things.  I am basically going to try to make a web community under the pirate flag of THE ARMADA, do not repeat that without using all capitals, out of respect for the fallen comrades, thanks, but in making this community again it requires a code place.  I mean a place to put the code, that we work on.  Fun part about gitea is it has communities for things like this.  When I first tried to make this community I also tried the google shit, that supposed business email, groups, etc shit, and I say shit because just like amazon I can't imagine how such a terrible corporation is s filthy rich..  Anyways.  So I thought this time I would make a mail server on my <code> Network Throughput I/O </code> domain <code>Packets.cc</code> ..  Anyways, and I found a thing, I haven't seen it yet, but in debian repositories <code>mailman3-web</code> (i think it was).  I guess it uses a thing called <code>HyperKitty</code> and Django for a web app that handles mail?  I'm willing to give it a try!<br/><br/>
As well, I'm not sure why I'm struggling to understand and deal with figuring out how the F to host a uWSGI, or any WSGI, server for proxying my https from my <b>FLASK PROJECT!!</b> 😄😄😄😄  Yes, I am VERY much happy that I am learning a new, and in my opinion possibly better than Laravel, web application framework.  I'm pretty sure very very few people know one thing about me, and that is that I really enjoy web applications and creating them gives me a helluva a good feeling when confronted with all the ideas I get for building web apps.  This is truly what I was destined to do I think but anyways, so, I'm really stoked about Flask, and Pythons!<br/><br/>
It is questionable whether the page is or will be operational, but <a href="https://musicplace.vip" target="_blank">MUSICPLACE.Vip</a> and JUST TODAY!  I managed to figure out how <code>uWSGI</code> works, at least enough that it's rendering the CSS files.  It's a work in progress though, and I'm not giving out the password until it's stable.  Afterwards I might ask a couple of folks if they want to poke it, meaning with a pen, just to know I build my flask app sturdy.<br/><br/>
I shall return for more EPIC POST!  GIT ER DRUNK, BAMBOOZLE HER, THEN PARTY AT MY POST!  LoL I just made that up, stupid, I know.<br/><br/>
<b>PLUS:</b> As for XMPP, which I fail to properly rage quit, and I am permanently a slave to, I discovered that one of my new years resolutions for 2024 will be that if I'm going to always be a strange and weird XMPP server operator, I might as well be better at it.  Blimey trolls!  OH AND ONE MORE THING: I shall be doing CSS/layout type modifications to the8woodcutter.sh, to make it actually worth visiting.  There's a slight chance that this intention gets lost in the abyss of my many missions but let's propose it happens, and you might love the changes when they come, bon voyage!  😵

Something I think XMPP could benefit from

    <font><b><i>     chunk</i></b>🚬</font>
    <br/><br/>
    I think XMPP could benefit from more web based stuff.  Like, as far as I know there is <a href="https://toofast.vip" target="_blank">Conversejs</a> which runs over BOSH <i>or</i> Websockets, and is basically entirely a javascript (ewww) application.  It's prettty nice I am using it on <b>TooFast.vip</b> right now and in an iframe on <a href="/" target="_blank">The8Woodcutter.sh</a>.
    <br/><br/>
    There is also a much nicer web client (full) called movim and it has an AGPL+ licence (i think) and you can iterate either of both of these types of web clients on your own server for your users and federate also, so that any user can use it, in Jabber Land.
    <br/><br/>
    There's another one too xmpp-web or something?  <a href="https://github.com/nioc/xmpp-web" target="_blank">Here on Github</a> (official???) and I have yet to try this one, in fact why don't I try it tonight?  I'm not entirely sure I'm up for the challenge though :/
    <br/><br/>
    ANYWAYS so what I think is good for XMPP is if there were more utilities for accessing XMPP network.  Such as a service discovery tool, standalone not in any already pre-existing full web client, and a standalone pubsub explorer would be effen mystical to have.  Just as standalone mini-apps.  So like let's think, perhaps the pubsub viewer just requires websockets connection and access to websockets API for an XMPP server.  One could make a custom/community lua script for prosody as a module for a (example:) <code>mod_web_pubsub_viewer</code> and upload it to prosody's open community plugins.  For ejabberd compliance, I'm scared of thinking of even writing a module for ejabberd, erlang is scary, but, perhaps just add it as simple as possible as a websockets extension if websockets is a listener value in ejabberd config like for instance <code>:5443/ws</code> might be all you need.  Then what the actual module is mostly made up of is the viewer content in html/php/python/whatever (<i>and please GOD don't use some obtuse not meant for web language I nor most major web developers are going to use like Rust or C++ or Kotlin or Golang or some dumb shit just use PHP for us normal people</i>).  So it's two parts: can it read and authenticate websockets data on xmpp, and is it nice looking web widget PHP/HTML/CSS plus..
    <br/><br/>
    I actually, for once, since most of any time I share my ideas, as I do have GREAT ideas OFTEN and they get poached and done way ahead of my ability timewise, for once, I doubt anybody is going to do this so I'm going to put it on my list of stuff to build.  That way, if for any reason you want to just <code>[Login]</code> box then <code>[Search Hostname]</code> then a tree view of any applicable pubsub material (preferably public stuff, fully federated) and a <code>[Sub]</code> or <code>[UnSub]</code> and/or as time goes by more options thta pertain to subscribing to pubsub items.  I still have no idea how they're pushed to subscribers.  I can only recall seeing it once before, and once another time I did a thing (can't recall) where it posted payload data too (more than just a dumb ping with one word irrelevant of anything saying what it is or where it came from).  So this is a lot of discovery and code and XMPP stanzas to file through.
    <br/><br/>
    I'm still waiting on a stable place to live so I can accelerate really good into this stuff as it stresses me out and is a disability, I suppose, to not be sitting on a couch I know I can get really involved in something that will take months.  In regards to having found a home, I've just moved to a smaller place in my province and it's been cool so far, I hope I can find a way to stay long time.
