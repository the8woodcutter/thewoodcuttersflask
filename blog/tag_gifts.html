Greetings!  It is I, the mystical Woodcutter, who as it has been said he came from the forest.
<br/><br/>
I am going to attempt to convey a particular perspective I have of myself, so that it might be of some perspective to others as to why I am the way I am plus why you should not insult autistic people by using the nature of their disabilities as a prejudice term.  I have seen people say shit like, "i see the room here is autistic", or on Eve Online of all places, "that alliance is spergs", and that means asperger's syndrome people.
<br/><br/>
Allow me to give you my definition of a person who has traits of the high functioning, autism spectrum, disorder called asperger's syndrome.  Their brains and their mental powers have a bias, one weaker sway than is to a much stronger sway.  In fact the weaknesses can cancel out the strengths, and vice versa because these types of people are known to have curious areas of inherited extreme intelligence.  Meaning that for maybe NASA type shit, they engineered something impossible just because that strength they had was able to see through what an ordinary person could not perceive.  The downsides, as far as I know, of people with this illness have a tendency to be unable to relate to emotion well, connect to others socially maybe without purpose, like small talk is meaningless to them, and they fail or have difficulty getting along with the other folks uninhibited by a mental condition.  It's pretty clear cut how I see it, considering that in my past I was considered to have this illness but never for sure, that people like this can definitely power excel at things like software, intercommunicable things, abstracts, highly complicated systems like networks or server racks, understanding software stacks and becoming quickly and easily fluent with such things beyond that of a regular person.
<br/><br/>
I do not think it is because of any passion risen out of lack of satisfactory human interaction, I think it is a literal factor of imbalance but a beautiful thing because these people might be a little weird, a little offputting even (at worst), but they'll generally have you fixed up ASAP.
<br/><br/>
I've always thought of life this way: people think in images, words, emotions and logic, only one of these.  I personally think logically, so I can route a quick way to a solution if abstracts are clear to me but I'll get frustrated without clear abstracts.  I am also going to tend to find solutions in, erm, everything.  However I am limited by my ability to empathyze, rather, show empathy where that shown empathy gets reciprocated to a healthy human interaction.  So though you said your old neighbor, R.I.P. Chase G., you were fucking wild buddy, had he died, I will likely struggle to show you what your emotions beckon from me.  This DOES cause problems with me and others because they get wrong impressions ALL THE TIME.  It's just not in my mental capacity to act on that tether of humanity, but give me some creative web design project, holy shit, I'll make that shine!  Or die tryin!  Not because of devotion, or motivation but because of my alley of success.
<br/><br/>
I've seen people use autism as some prejudice terms in chats a I would like to flame them every time because they don't realize some autistic people can wreck their house up from across the globe if we wanted to.  I've found in XMPP numerous people that exhibit this sort of mental paradigm and they are indeed hackers, and possibly very dangerous people if motivated.  Speaking of the keyboard and of myself also.  Not always the case though.  Autistic people can be really good at anything they set their minds to.
<br/><br/>
I like to combine segments of software, in use and in idea, figuratively and factually, to enjoy my time most of all creatively.  I define creative as "as to create" ...  create anything.  If computing is about solving problems, purely plain and simple you might have noticed, I break that boundary, with creativitiy.  Yet I still happy to write a python script that solves a problem, then back it up to my <code>/home/$USER/bin</code> directory <code>export PATH=$PATH:/home/chunk/bin</code> and execute it again and again by it's name.  I thrive on complexity.
<br/><br/>
