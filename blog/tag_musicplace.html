Greetings Internet People.  I thought I would write a post here now about new stuff that's happened-ning.<br/><br/>
So that music site project I was talking about in the last post, it's much nice now!  You can check it out here: <a href="https://musicplace.vip" target="_blank">MusicPlace.Vip</a>.  I kept the same theme of top level domain (the ".vip") as my other favorite domain name "TooFast.vip" (which is my main XMPP server host).  I originally thought of just using a subdomain, as "musicplace.toofast.vip", but was very attracted to the appearance of "MusicPlace.vip" and it was only about 7 dollars Canadian.  So over the winter holidays, xmas season, I been occasionally working on this flask application, in part to learn flask web application framework using python language, but also because I had a motivation and that was to be able to share music links on XMPP chats that are not rewritten filenames to some bullcrap non-human readable hash string, and are from a creative origin.  The idea was that if I'm playing my music in my VLC or Poweramp app while out and about and I find a cool track in my same collection, as on phone as on server, that instead of uploading the file as it is and it get renamed to aerjnoiub98eronbo.flac, I want that filename to show what the file is!  Sometimes people don't want to download crap that has no readable name, as well sometimes people want to keep their file they downloaded, so if I shared it it was for them to listen to sure, but the option to keep it is now successful because going through their files they'll find a file that's named a way they can know wtf it is.  Makes sense right?  But XMPP and some of the developers for client software and such have a different political idea of how HTTP upload file shares should work.  Not many people believe that uploads are away of sharing files, they're supposed to be inline images, or something really web 3.0 bullshit.  I find that XMPP is losing it's original web chat spirit because of these "phone fags" as some people would call them, that only think in their development and software progression like a phone user.  Sad, really, cuz I am oldschool about web stuff, and I found a lot of value in the way things used to be but see it actively unable to exist anymore.  I guess such is life.<br/><br/>
So "MusicPlace.vip" the file, or the "/musiclist", is locked by a super secret password, and at this time it is really only myself that gets to use that as I recently changed the passwd and probably will somewhat often.  I wanted also to be able to share my music files, which a lot of them are in fact paid for and HQ audio, but I didn't like it as an open public webserver directory as I'm not sure but I don't think that's legal, I really don't know becacuse I cannot digest terms + services legal jargon, who reads that stuff anyways?  NOBODY!  So but I may have heard it's not legal or something, I don't really believe that because as I said that the purpose is to share them the only available way to XMPP chat.  I did due diligence, and whatever.<br/><br/>
I am really stoked about the CSS (styles) though, it seems I've created a theme with it too because I've created a subdomain (another simpler flask project inside the musicplace project) that is my place to post a public prayer.  I follow the Christian faith.  I thought of this as a cool way to praise the Lord.  It also uses a similar almost same CSS theme, you can view that at <a href="https://prayers.musicplace.vip" target="_blank">prayers.musicplace.vip</a>.  <b>It is not finished yet</b>.<br/><br/>
Another thing, I suppose I wouldn't be proud of, is a bullshit saga going on that I'm making the most of with humour and no fucks given, is a saga where I was originally banished back to an XMPP group chat I thoroughly hate and in such banishment, which not a nice thing to do, I suppose I've seized the opportunity to shit all over that chat and do and say whatever the hell I want cuz <a href="../ufq.html" target="_blank">fuck you</a>.  That's because they all did an offence to me and already hate me and think bads things about me so I am indeed being a plague and don't care, you cannot nor will not be able to make me care.  LoL..  Stubborn, I know, but in my eyes it's worth the hilarity it causes sometimes and I should learn to care less about what internet people have to say, not in the way that it creates more problems for folks, just that I have been known to get offended.  People don't care to unnofffend me once offending me and I cry a lot because of this, and so, I am now perpetually full retard until enough of my JIDs are banned I feel successful.<br/><br/>
So yea, that's the happening today for recently.  I am enjoying flask, because I enjoy pythons, and the creative juices are a flowing!  If you want the password for the music app, only authorized people are allowed to ask me on XMPP as my JID is, you will have to figure that out.  I'm not giving it out publicly anymore.  So on this day it is good to be alive and thank God for all things provided, he is much our true captain and leader and rememberig Him is loving Him who loves us.  <code>pEAcE</code>
