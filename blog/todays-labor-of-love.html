    So yesterday evening I was getting, once again, upset with my busted nvidia drivers and my libvirt not working.  I needed the nvidia drivers because I wanted to test out if my Win11 disk (my slow SSD, bahaha) can run games if my entire one (1) screen is ran by nvidia.  However I couldn't fix OpenSUSE-Prime (<code>systemctl status prime-select</code>) and it was dumping cores and stack traces and shiez.  Then for no good reason <code>virt-manager</code> refused to load qemu/kvm:// and refused to connect.  I like to speak a bunch like I know things, and when I do, I do know those things, but sometimes I can't be full of pride and think I'm very good if any good worth a shit at some stuff and I have / had no effen clue how to debug libvirt errors.  Lest I even bothered, I had failed to work on nvidia prior to that.
<br/><br/>
    As it may have been known, at least to some aliens, I have been running OpenSUSE (Open Source Community Based Enterprise Linux (RPM Type distribution of Linux)) and it's been a love hate relationship, mostly of love.  I love SELinux and the fact that it's extra contexts sandbox core hardware, kernel and system level accesses and with OpenSUSE TUMBLEWEED (Not supported in Leap) SELinux enforcing targeted policy is an option in the installation.  It can also (and I don't know how awesome or even a point this would be) apparmor at the same time.  Being an enterprise linux it's got a lot of security, that's basically it.  Centos 7 was my first enterprise linuxes and back when it actually came with compliance security schematics for like, government security and you could enable a security policy meant for a hospital or something...  I imagine.  OpenSUSE has taken me a while to get used to because of the linking of standard things like <code>sudo cp /root/Xorg.conf.neww /etc/X11/xorg.conf</code> or the <code>grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg</code> and typical MANUAL stuff that I'm used to with 📦ArchLinux📦 so it's pissed me off a few times, like when I had to discover that (and don't quote me on this, but it's how it appeared at the time) in order to change your desktop manager or your xsession (desktop environment) you needed to use a "helper" script lol helper, <code>update-alternatives --config default.xsession</code> and it brings up an interactive thing you can choose which DE/DM you want, if you have a few.  However this, 'dynamic linking'?  IS THIS WHAT THIS IS?!?!?!  Is NO WHERE'S NEAR AS BAD AS ON Vultr.com or Ovh.com hosted host hosts.  I've tried with all my might to overwrite and <code>chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf</code> yet that stupid cloud-init shit overwrites and links back and forth everything so bad it's maddening.
<br/><br/>
    Suffice to say, I switched to Vultr.com for hosting for now.  Not a big difference from linode.  Considerably more expensive for less though and their cheapest "bare metal" server is 120USD / month (there was 2 available at the time).  I got a $250 credit with vultr.com and I had fallen into some hardship IRL with money and a place to live and stuff costing me all my money, all. I couldn't afford liniode for the time being.  Now however, I want to tell you that I am sad about this and I highly maximum rate <a href="https://cloud.linode.com">Linode.com</a> as I've been with them for I dunno how many years.  ANYWAYS.  SO I reinstalled my OpenSUSE over the night, took me a few hours to backup my shit, then I ended up wanting to try and install a bootloaderless (efi, secureboot, tpm) iteration on a bum partition, that failed, so I started again.  THIS TIME, despite how much I <b>HATE</b> using anything other than NetworkManager I remembered to use Wicked network crap and have to relearn it.  Suppose no big deal, as long as I don't come to a dead end for a week.  The reason for that is because network bridge autoconfiguration for Xen hypervisor and Qemu hypervisor you need wicked or else you'd need to find a proper guide and follow it.  Unless you're fkn leet and you run doez sockets anyhow.
<br/><br/>
    I always use xfce4.  If I use anything but xfce4 it's RARELY KDE/Plasma5 or it's usually i3wm.  Sometimes I use lxqt (on archlinux) and already have i3wm install beforehand and it meshes better as the window manager for lxqt on 📦ArchLinux📦 than others I've tried, and got annoyed.
<br/><b>Lemme show you what I'm most happy with today, that I was spending my other half of my time doing:</b>

    So recently for something to do I made a weather.php script, a hitcounter.php script and I had another one I was going to do too, for <a href="https://the8woodcutter.sh" target="_blank">The8Woodcutter.sh</a> but I didn't like the color composition of the basically, erm, crap.  Yea I had crap underneath the THE8WOODCUTTER banner and I ripped dat outta ther and were left with this space.  I thought to myself two things: this is the way it was originally, big deal.  As well, why not put a WIDGET or some WIDGETSsSSSs there?  STUFF THAT I MADE MYSELF?  STUFF THAT IS COMPLEX?  I mean, no joke ass "plug it in" WP plugins that are a nightmare to tweak their obtuse OOP entangled shit so you get what you want but MAKE WHAT i WANT.  I have a few ideas for portable widgets, that would be for #1: portable, #2: generally placeable on any webpage not running fucking erlang or some kookey shit like golang (sorry to those that really dig it) PHP or Python, like Flask, Django, Laravel, basic PHP, hell just an PHP enabled server that will simply just run php, but you gotta convert the files to<code><?php echo phpinfo(); ?></code>, jokes, hopefully that doesn't ruin my post :| ....  PHP FILES.  NOT HARD NEWBS.
<br/><br/>
    NOW I HAVE PUTTED A PORTABLE XMPP CLIENT ONTO MY BLOG PAGE WHICH IS HOSTED ELSEWHERE!
<br/><br/>
    My score for this software at time of posting is ✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✪✫ [9.65/10] 
<br/><sup>                (judged lesser because it has ONLY JUST BEGUN!)</sup>
