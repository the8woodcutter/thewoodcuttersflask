I decided I am going to build yet another web application.  This will be my second flask web application and will be a growing of a couple of eve online game tools that use the game's API.  Flask is a really cool lightweight web application framework using python language and it's often used for constructing API's.  It seems to me to only make sense that it should be well suited to work with API's all around.  As well it does have some <code>JSON</code> commands embedded into it that simplify API calls.  I want to pursue my lust of web application building and along with building this new project I also plan to try and seal the deal, per say, or rather finish musicplace.vip.  It's mission in life, that web app of mine, was always simple and of a certain point.  It has basically served to create the solution I sought.<br/><br/>
o about the new application I need to solve two eve online game problems.  One is the tiers of industry materials/items and their interconnecting complexity.  It is very difficult to perceive what is needed for what when the blueprints, materials, minerals, etc are cascaded on multiple tiers and have, although a fixed structure generally, a non linear structure that differs for all end result items.  I've used a couple of other "industry calculators" and indfustry tools but I want one that will just simply programmatically spit out a tree of what is needed, what is given, what is next and make it printable so a guy can upload the text file to eve and use it to purchase on the market.  I actually have a vision of this, as I've thought about it for most of my time playing eve.  I love that this game has such a detailed API access for all players.<br/><br/>
Another thing, thought for some reason I cannot see it anymore, my one character's networth balooned to well over 100 billion isk and I do not know why.  I would like to be able to search my inventory, which can be listed with some details (I would iagine), but based on estimated value like it shows in a tooltip in game when you hover over it.  Imagining that somewhere, somehow, a publicly available subset or aggragate of market data exists I might use it, and keep it's regularly updated data refreshed in my application then program a method to search by value of item.  That is according to estimated value or perhaps Jita/Amarr (faction trade hubs) buy/sell price at the time.  Now I just thought here that I could probably get away with even only using data from the major hubs, or a selection of hubs, or depending on the complexity of information I could grab even a customizable set of data of market prices.  Whatever.<br/><br/>
Suppose that this can be a learning exercise for effectively coordinating API calls, a unique web front end and a considerable size of data.  Plus not forgetting the logic involved in these functions is kind of extensive.<br/><br/>
I'm not going to place high expectations on myself at the moment, due to a great discomfort with my life's situation lately and that being volatile to my ability to focus, but, if only I started then I should finish it at some point and be damn proud.<br/><br/>
As a last piece of interest: I've stated a new goal today that is to be working effectively in the IT industry by my mid 40s (less than 10 yrs or approx).  So if such a project idea as this one sustains and is maintained then it might help me down the road :)  Cheers to beers friends!

Greetings Internet People.  I thought I would write a post here now about new stuff that's happened-ning.<br/><br/>
So that music site project I was talking about in the last post, it's much nice now!  You can check it out here: <a href="https://musicplace.vip" target="_blank">MusicPlace.Vip</a>.  I kept the same theme of top level domain (the ".vip") as my other favorite domain name "TooFast.vip" (which is my main XMPP server host).  I originally thought of just using a subdomain, as "musicplace.toofast.vip", but was very attracted to the appearance of "MusicPlace.vip" and it was only about 7 dollars Canadian.  So over the winter holidays, xmas season, I been occasionally working on this flask application, in part to learn flask web application framework using python language, but also because I had a motivation and that was to be able to share music links on XMPP chats that are not rewritten filenames to some bullcrap non-human readable hash string, and are from a creative origin.  The idea was that if I'm playing my music in my VLC or Poweramp app while out and about and I find a cool track in my same collection, as on phone as on server, that instead of uploading the file as it is and it get renamed to aerjnoiub98eronbo.flac, I want that filename to show what the file is!  Sometimes people don't want to download crap that has no readable name, as well sometimes people want to keep their file they downloaded, so if I shared it it was for them to listen to sure, but the option to keep it is now successful because going through their files they'll find a file that's named a way they can know wtf it is.  Makes sense right?  But XMPP and some of the developers for client software and such have a different political idea of how HTTP upload file shares should work.  Not many people believe that uploads are away of sharing files, they're supposed to be inline images, or something really web 3.0 bullshit.  I find that XMPP is losing it's original web chat spirit because of these "phone fags" as some people would call them, that only think in their development and software progression like a phone user.  Sad, really, cuz I am oldschool about web stuff, and I found a lot of value in the way things used to be but see it actively unable to exist anymore.  I guess such is life.<br/><br/>
So "MusicPlace.vip" the file, or the "/musiclist", is locked by a super secret password, and at this time it is really only myself that gets to use that as I recently changed the passwd and probably will somewhat often.  I wanted also to be able to share my music files, which a lot of them are in fact paid for and HQ audio, but I didn't like it as an open public webserver directory as I'm not sure but I don't think that's legal, I really don't know becacuse I cannot digest terms + services legal jargon, who reads that stuff anyways?  NOBODY!  So but I may have heard it's not legal or something, I don't really believe that because as I said that the purpose is to share them the only available way to XMPP chat.  I did due diligence, and whatever.<br/><br/>
I am really stoked about the CSS (styles) though, it seems I've created a theme with it too because I've created a subdomain (another simpler flask project inside the musicplace project) that is my place to post a public prayer.  I follow the Christian faith.  I thought of this as a cool way to praise the Lord.  It also uses a similar almost same CSS theme, you can view that at <a href="https://prayers.musicplace.vip" target="_blank">prayers.musicplace.vip</a>.  <b>It is not finished yet</b>.<br/><br/>
Another thing, I suppose I wouldn't be proud of, is a bullshit saga going on that I'm making the most of with humour and no fucks given, is a saga where I was originally banished back to an XMPP group chat I thoroughly hate and in such banishment, which not a nice thing to do, I suppose I've seized the opportunity to shit all over that chat and do and say whatever the hell I want cuz <a href="../ufq.html" target="_blank">fuck you</a>.  That's because they all did an offence to me and already hate me and think bads things about me so I am indeed being a plague and don't care, you cannot nor will not be able to make me care.  LoL..  Stubborn, I know, but in my eyes it's worth the hilarity it causes sometimes and I should learn to care less about what internet people have to say, not in the way that it creates more problems for folks, just that I have been known to get offended.  People don't care to unnofffend me once offending me and I cry a lot because of this, and so, I am now perpetually full retard until enough of my JIDs are banned I feel successful.<br/><br/>
So yea, that's the happening today for recently.  I am enjoying flask, because I enjoy pythons, and the creative juices are a flowing!  If you want the password for the music app, only authorized people are allowed to ask me on XMPP as my JID is, you will have to figure that out.  I'm not giving it out publicly anymore.  So on this day it is good to be alive and thank God for all things provided, he is much our true captain and leader and rememberig Him is loving Him who loves us.  <code>pEAcE</code>

<b>Heya internet.  Whappens moew?</b><br/><br/>
<img src="/img/me.smmoke.w.specs.8.jpg" alt="I wear my sunglasses at winter..." /><br/><br/>
So this past 2 days has been gruelling, back breaking, barely withstandable labour to do a handful of things.  I am basically going to try to make a web community under the pirate flag of THE ARMADA, do not repeat that without using all capitals, out of respect for the fallen comrades, thanks, but in making this community again it requires a code place.  I mean a place to put the code, that we work on.  Fun part about gitea is it has communities for things like this.  When I first tried to make this community I also tried the google shit, that supposed business email, groups, etc shit, and I say shit because just like amazon I can't imagine how such a terrible corporation is s filthy rich..  Anyways.  So I thought this time I would make a mail server on my <code> Network Throughput I/O </code> domain <code>Packets.cc</code> ..  Anyways, and I found a thing, I haven't seen it yet, but in debian repositories <code>mailman3-web</code> (i think it was).  I guess it uses a thing called <code>HyperKitty</code> and Django for a web app that handles mail?  I'm willing to give it a try!<br/><br/>
As well, I'm not sure why I'm struggling to understand and deal with figuring out how the F to host a uWSGI, or any WSGI, server for proxying my https from my <b>FLASK PROJECT!!</b> 😄😄😄😄  Yes, I am VERY much happy that I am learning a new, and in my opinion possibly better than Laravel, web application framework.  I'm pretty sure very very few people know one thing about me, and that is that I really enjoy web applications and creating them gives me a helluva a good feeling when confronted with all the ideas I get for building web apps.  This is truly what I was destined to do I think but anyways, so, I'm really stoked about Flask, and Pythons!<br/><br/>
It is questionable whether the page is or will be operational, but <a href="https://musicplace.vip" target="_blank">MUSICPLACE.Vip</a> and JUST TODAY!  I managed to figure out how <code>uWSGI</code> works, at least enough that it's rendering the CSS files.  It's a work in progress though, and I'm not giving out the password until it's stable.  Afterwards I might ask a couple of folks if they want to poke it, meaning with a pen, just to know I build my flask app sturdy.<br/><br/>
I shall return for more EPIC POST!  GIT ER DRUNK, BAMBOOZLE HER, THEN PARTY AT MY POST!  LoL I just made that up, stupid, I know.<br/><br/>
<b>PLUS:</b> As for XMPP, which I fail to properly rage quit, and I am permanently a slave to, I discovered that one of my new years resolutions for 2024 will be that if I'm going to always be a strange and weird XMPP server operator, I might as well be better at it.  Blimey trolls!  OH AND ONE MORE THING: I shall be doing CSS/layout type modifications to the8woodcutter.sh, to make it actually worth visiting.  There's a slight chance that this intention gets lost in the abyss of my many missions but let's propose it happens, and you might love the changes when they come, bon voyage!  😵

Happy updates to mrBot's doghouse!

<p>
Greetings internet!  I thought I would explain about some of the updates I've done to my XMPP chat bot <code>mrBot</code>.  It's funny, at one time <code>mrBot</code> was probably more famous than I am in XMPP world.  In case you <b>still</b> don't know what XMPP is, that I continuously refer to, allow me to explain shortly:
<br/><br/>
XMPP (eXtensible messaging and presence protocol) is not a web program, persay, as the "web" runs primarily as websites using <code>HTTP</code> on ports <code>80,443</code> in the internet network among the world.  So websites are the "web" and this is a chat protocol that is open source, fully open and standardized, and has matured over 22 years since the days of yahoo messenger, icq, aim, aol, etceter, those 90s chat programs you used to have to chat with people from around the world.  Well, all of those are dead, except for XMPP and IRC, which in my humble opinion will <b>never</b> die.  IRC (internet relay chat) has been around quite a lot longer than XMPP however THE CLOSEST thing to IRC that exists today is XMPP and XMPP is extensible beyond comprehension.  It has what are called <code>XEP</code> sub protocols for features used within the XMPP master protocol and can do things that IRC typically can't or won't do, or not typically, like HTTP file uploads, publish subscribe (pubsub) services for infinite blogging, status, real time syndication type of stuff.  If you've ever used Discord (gross) then you are aware that you can see your mates' status lines (under their name), whether they're online (green), away (orange), or invisible, etcetera, this is called "presence" and XMPP pioneered it FIRST.
<br/><br/>
One of the common things about open source stuff, especially as massive as XMPP as a protocol and a realm in which folks have build many many open source projects for use of it, is that rich fucks like Google and Facebook (yes, both have and did) have used the XMPP protocol for their google chat, facebook messenger, and once upon a time not too long ago you could actually connect to their networks using XMPP but not anymore!  Embrace, extend, extinguish, was their intentions.  Fail.  The awesome thing I love about XMPP is that <cod>A:</code> you can host your own instance, on your own domain, quite easily with a bit of linux skills, <code>B:</code> the entire scene is federated, just like email.  You have what's called a JID (jabber ID, because XMPP was originally called Jabber) which is simply a username@domain and unlike IRC, and some other platforms, that are newer and far inferior, you can TOTALLY expect to get access to the entire federated public realm of chats.  However there's a great many security features as well, and instance operators can choose to make their MUCs (multi user chats) private, moderated (require voice to chat), members only, and even enable E2EE (end to end encryption) in group chats.  So it's pretty covert if you want it to considering putting your instance on the tor or the i2p network.
<br/><br/>
Yes XMPP is fully open and public and it's beyond comprehension how extensible it is, and if you get to know the folks on there you can get to know how to make the most of XMPP.  A lot of folks become rather interested in computing, linux and self hosting services on linux servers.  A perfect place for me.
<br/><br/>
So I've made a bot, I started building <code>mrBot</code> about 2 years ago with the <a href="https://errbot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">ErrBot</a> multi protocol chat bot framework but I was dissatisfied with the errors and the bugs.  I eventually went with <a href="https://slixmpp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">SliXMPP</a> which is a mere library fully suited for XMPP bot building, among other amazing things.  This has enabled me to grow my python skills a lot!
<br/><br/>
So what I am happy about today is that I have polished up some bugs with <code>mrBot</code>.  Namely his awesomes function where he can accept a count, positive or negative, for any string almost.  I also finished rebuilding some functions that I had him doing when I was using ErrBot like the rolling of dice.  When you write "Roll 55" for example he'll output this:
<br/><br/>
<code>⚂ ⚁ ⚄ ⚂ ⚄ ⚅ ⚁ ⚅ ⚄ ⚁ ⚁ ⚄ ⚁ ⚀ ⚀ ⚅ ⚃ ⚀ ⚀ ⚅ ⚄ ⚀ ⚄ ⚁ ⚃ ⚅ ⚄ ⚂ ⚀ ⚅ ⚄ ⚁ ⚅ ⚀ ⚂ ⚁ ⚂ ⚂ ⚅ ⚁ ⚁ ⚃ ⚅ ⚄ ⚁ ⚄ ⚅ ⚀ ⚄ ⚁ ⚀ ⚁ ⚄ ⚅ ⚃</code>
<br/><br/>
A totally randomized dice for as many as you specify.  I realize it's kinda dumb, but it's entertaining to me, and <code>mrBot's</code> entire purpose is to teach me Python language.  Another thing I finished up was his "Food {food}" function where I've written pretty long lists for things you can "feed" <code>mrBot</code> and he'll have a cool answer to depending which category of lists you select what you guess for feeeding him.  Yea <code>mrBot</code> is kinda like my pet, in fact he's "my dog" and I do get pissed off when people kick him from the chats LoL...
<br/><br/>
SO aside from these obviously fully useless non-utility bot functions, tht are merely entertaining at most, I have finally done something, and begun to build actually useful bot functions for <code>mrBot</code>.  Namely network utilities.  Once in a while, like today for example, we'd be in a chat talking about how another operator has got a configuration issue where his server cannot reach mine, for example.  One of the common routines in this is some network command tools like ping, and some dns lookup tools, etc, that can help diagnose the network and come to a solution.  Well it's sure handy, if you think about it, to be able to search DNS records, with record types, and also to be able to ping with ipv4 and ipv6 another host, via a bot in that very chat, it makes things transparent and easily accessable.  So I've created today a <code>host</code>, a <code>ping</code> and a <code>ping6</code> tools for mrBot.  Tomorrow, if I'm feeling up to it I'd like to make the harder one which is the <code>dig</code> command so that that pretty much covers the basic most common tools for initial network probing.
<br/><br/>
I think, though honestly more like a really long time ago, this definitely permafries me as a NERD.  Ahahaha, which is awesome, cuz I love to do this stuff and it's functional uses are fun for the future too.  It's worth it to me to have spent numerous hours today to make this collection of bot upgrades, as I'm also expanding my python skills and learning new concepts and better use of the language and it's syntax ^^
<br/><br/>
A veteran web developer named Sam from Scotland, who somewhat mentored me a few years back over skype, taught me to have a practical use example for things you study if you're having a hard time understanding them.  You honestly can't just brute force learn stuff without such strategies, I'm serious.  You'll never get hands on experience.  This is how I've enjoyed over past years creating stuff, and then going slightly really astray and building my own custom stuff that impresses, all from learning.
<br/><br/>
That's enough rambling.  I had a certain long time friend in mind who I wanted to read my blog, I'm pretty sure he's not aware of it, he may not even be interested in it, but I had you in mind coatrack buddy for this cuz I think u'd be stoked.  <b>pEAcE</b> !

Greetings fellow netizons.  It is I, the woodcutter a.k.a. chunk from xmpp/irc.  I wanted to ramble a bit about what I've been working on with an awesome python library for making XMPP chat bots called <a href="https://slixmpp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html" target="_blank">SliXMPP</a>.  I have had for approximately two years now a bot of my own name <code>mrBot</code> and at one time he was more famous than I am in XMPP as everybody love him.  <code>mrBot</code> was my original python project for learning while exercising python and it started with errbot the multiprotocol bot framework actually.  It was a little bit too in depth and took me a long time to just get the configurations to work smoothly but then after not maintaining interest in it because of it's often bugs and inconsistencies I got slacking and bored of it.  What made me switch from this errbot project was that I was using a docker container, and this errbot can load in a list of MUCs or IRC channels so one docker container is good.  However that container was dated, as with most images on the docker hub, I eventually learned when in IRC a spammer had completely abused it inside out and the "ACL" or supposed access control list was null, it was configured and I swore it was fine, but worked not at all.  That was crappy.  So i ended up figuring out from a friend Shokara, who had the idea, was to use a biboumi transport, that can use IRC in XMPP client software, and so with XMPP ACL's working I could resume using <code>mrBot</code> in IRC but I lost a few benefits due to the nickname/JID translation.  Finally I was working on a cool plugin I called <code>err-megaphone</code> lol that <code>mrBot</code> would take from an admin only an argument, which is a message, after a command then send that whole argument to all the chats he is currently in.  So it could broadcast muc/channel wide whatever.  I thought this could have so much been so much fun to make and it was absolutely meant for XMPP, as <code>mrBot</code> lives in XMPP world, but I kept getting some dumb async error, and worked like an idiot for waaay waaay too long and gave up because errbot, I dunno, I don't think it's maintained by more than maybe one guy, and not maintained well I think.  It's however a multiprotocol bot program so it's huge.  I gave up and after about 3-6 more months passed and I decided that a library isn't going to hide from me so hard and get lost in object oriented programmiing aspects, in classes and namespaces and <b>aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</b> omg.
<br/><br/>
Holy moley was I correct.  SliXMPP is really not hard, it is no harder than errbot, in fact probably a fair bit easier and sooooo much simpler.  As well for learning Pythons, it's helped me boost my level in <code>/usr/bin/python3.10</code> a <b>LOT</b>.  However anytime you want to check out or use and modify the errbot plugins I made you're welcome to find them all on <a href="https://git.sr.ht/~cmdr_chunk" target="_blank">git.sr.ht/~cmdr_chunk</a>.  He had a food function, where chatters could feed him things, it had 4 lists of foods, for 4 response.  What I think made <code>mrBot</code> so awesome is the response I made for him to act like a dog because his avatar in XMPP is indeed a cute pixelate dog.  "My doggo" and when jan6 kicks him from #offtopic on ircnow I get on his case "you kicked my dogg, i keel you!  i will jump this fence and keel you and your family!" lmfao if you get the reference.
<br/><br/>
So in SliXMPP I've recreated and basically perfected a particular function that another popular IRC bot program called bitbot does.  I guess not so popular I cant find it's code on a web search, not the OFFICIAL code at least.  It's originally called "Karma" where if you quote somebody with a <code>++</code> to say nice work, or what have you, and likewise <code>--</code> in case they bad person or something.  I remade this SOOOOO much better.  I called it Awesomes.  Because it's not a person based thing, you can <code>++/--</code> any string you want using certain regex parsed characters under I think it's 22 characters or so.  As well not just at the beginning of the message on first character you start it, you can <code>++</code> a string like <code>pythons++</code> right here <code><<<</code> mid sentence and even <code>pythons++++++</code> again and it will catch them and increment / decrement the string for a saved count.  It uses shelve with python, it's new python3 shelve stuff that can REALLY easily save simple parameters to a database file and be modded and read again anytime later.  Anyhow, the awesomes function of <code>mrBot</code> does sooo much things better than bitbot and it's practical use case is fun and makes sense.  I've put a lot of work into it for my SliXMPP doghouse for <code>mrBot</code> and it's very well done.  Also I didn't mention that to use spaces instead of simply words space delimited you'd use "word"-- and even "word%%!"+++++++++++++++++++++++ and it parses correctly.  We've tested this function very much in IRC and good times ^^
<br/><br/>
I will tell of more <code>mrBot</code> tales another time folks, this has gotten long, come to XMPP or irc.ircnow.org and find me as <code>chunk</code>,<code>b0t</code>,<code>cmdr_coconut</code> or <code>cmdr_melon</code> on #offtopic, #armada, etcetera.  Bon Voyage!!

<p>You know with Python programming you can make a list/array out of any string piece by peice as single characters yes?  All you need to do is get the string length and divide it per len() into a list then you can allow functions over the iterable list of each character.  With that being said a guy could replace each letter of the alphabet with another charcter out of the unicode character map and make programmed unicode art!<br><br>I have more ideas like this but they're all mine >:) ..  For now ^^</p>
