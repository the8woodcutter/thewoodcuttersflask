As for the title, I dunno either, good question though right?  What's crackin up in your ip ports eh?  Anything juicy?  For me I've had a bit of a run of bad luck.  I spent a lot of money on a dedicated server from OVH to only be so utterly pissed off with the fact that A: I could not get an IPMI/KVM interface with the, what would've been, cheap dedicated server I had, B: that device to get added cost me WAY more money than I budgeted or originally expected to pay for dedicated hardware server, C: customer service is most worst bullshit useless as tits on a bull, so, I won't use OVH again maybe ever.  They really do have the cheapest dedicated servers, and I wanted one to run REAL virtualization instead of LXC containers because at the time LXC was pissing me off also, but quite badly, as I was not able to get the containers to network and my steps to retrying were so lengthy I ran outta patience.  Well, waste begat waste because in the ambition for real virtualization was a huge waste also.  This is why I only as of now have a server again.  TooFast.vip (my XMPP chat server host) was down, this page was down, my flask project MusicPlace.vip was down, no public nothing since my budget for a server per month was wasted on OVH, and I emphasize WASTED.<br/><br/>
SUPRISE!!  Now I'm renting a VPS from some IRC friends.  The interface or management of it is lacklustre and entirely command line but now I've also found a way to make LXC containers friggin work.  With networking!  Did u know that libvirt has a package (in debian it's `<code>sudo apt install libvirt-daemon-driver-lxc</code>`) for managing LXC containers?  And if u ignore the Qemu aspect of libvirt (and virt-manager, etc) it can manage containers, and this scheme of brilliant software if I may say so myself, automagically makes LXC boxes run on <code>virbr0</code> which is libvirt's bridge for VMs.  More can be nmade with differing configurations though.  So, and I'm familiar with libvirt so YAY :D  On my laptop Debian I've succeeded at the new devops apparatus but in dev/test mode.  I know what to do, and some things I will run publicly will be used in LXC containers.  It's been a long time and I'm finally happy to say it's on the way!!!  Ahah, maybe somebody reading this is like "what, I don't see any boxes..." but that's because this is devops, it's on server side of my linux server, it's how the entire software abstracts correlate and network and work together so that the client can view my website, but me and my server are more secure being containerized, and replicable, if somebody fux up my WSGI server, I can just reiterate it, instead of the entire damn VPS server host itself.  It's reusable, more secure as it essentially fakes another operating system that is not supposed to have any knowledge it is a machine inside a machine.  The libvirt does all the management of software emulation and bricking off any sort of path traversal, chroot, jail, whatever stuff, if u know u know, if not, then at least be happy I made stuff more secure.  Or I'm working on it anyways ^^<br/><br/>
Here, lemme share with you a little art I made recently:<br/><br/>
<img src="/img/da.gif.gif" style="width: 168px; height: 68px; margin-left: 40px;" /><br/><br/>
I dunno if you've noticed but that's the background tile for this /blog page now.  Just random stuff ^^<br/><br/>
So in other news, I acquired another new Mini-ATX small form factor computer.  This one I was very very fortunate finding out just how powerful it is!  If you know what a mini-atx looks like, then you probably wouldn't suspect that it could have an additional graphics card added into it would ya...  Well this one has a PCI-E x8 and with a proprietary Lenovo made only riser card I can angle that to a x16 and THERE ACTUALLY IS some GPUs that fit and work just fine in this machine D:  >.....>>..>..<br/><br/>
I also found a huge write up about it, very detailed, maddest props to the guys that wrote that all out with all the references I needed to know how to turn my mini-atx into a legitimate gaming computer :D:D  That's cool!!<br/><br/>
Also I have gotten me a new laptop, a Lenovo X250 with a 12.5" diameter screen and a backlit keyboard :D:D  It's kewl.  Screw gaming laptops, they're shit, the bios/firmwares on gaming laptops is so easily corruptable, like the MSI and the alienware too i used to have pfff, but business class laptops are where it's at!  The security settings in Lenovo computers are GREAT.  AMAZING even.  So awesome, and they're always nice looking, feeling and running.  So I'm happy not being able to play NFS Unbound, for now.<br/><br/>
Oi, there'd be more news for this past month, but I will leave it at this.  I hope you enjoyed reading my stuff, and I will over the next time (given my stuff all stays stable) write more kkewl updates to the design of the8woodcutter.sh and lastly I do have some other post ideas, so stay tuned!  Get an RSS reader so you can get auto poppos on my shiz @_@<br/>
