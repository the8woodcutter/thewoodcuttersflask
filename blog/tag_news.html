Last couple weeks have been atrocious.  I literally maintain a seething venomous hatred for narcist people.  But the good news is I got a new mobo upgrade!  From an i5 to an i7 and all the little windows animations (not that I use binboez very often except to game) and the various tiny things, like keyboard responsiveness, have improved.  I originally needed a mobo for my mobile rig because I thrashed the SIM card slot so bad that I broke one of the pins from the board for the reading of the card, and even tore off the shield from the board too.  That happened the day after I had gotten the 4G modem for my laptop and I was very very sad.  Now I'm happy again, I have not only modem, SIM card slot (no SIM tho, too poor to pay for phone plan that when my phone died permanently too) but an upgrade to have nicer software effects <3<br/><br/>
I have fixed the server, I was locked out for a while cuz one day I decided to attempt to create a multiboot with kali and blackarch (i wanted pentesting distro on disk not vm) and the installer wiped all my disk.  NOW I DID BACKUP MY STUFF, BUT, I dumbassedly accidentally deleted <code>rm -rf * .*</code>, yea, and so <code>~/.ssh</code> unrecoverable after that.  I spent a few days mulling and complaining about the fact that I thought I'd have to download the server image, etc, etc, etc, while my landlord has f$$kkd the network here so bad that it's not possible to download that many GB in less than a week, seriously, so but I fixed it.  We're back.  Just lend me 20CAD now pls, so I can pay for the server.  People owe me money aren't paying me, my leg is recovering from broken knee, I give it lots of luv, but I hurt it again today :(((  I am sad and happy and WHERE AM I D:<br/><br/>
As for any other entertainment, stay tuned!  📺<br/><br/>

As for the title, I dunno either, good question though right?  What's crackin up in your ip ports eh?  Anything juicy?  For me I've had a bit of a run of bad luck.  I spent a lot of money on a dedicated server from OVH to only be so utterly pissed off with the fact that A: I could not get an IPMI/KVM interface with the, what would've been, cheap dedicated server I had, B: that device to get added cost me WAY more money than I budgeted or originally expected to pay for dedicated hardware server, C: customer service is most worst bullshit useless as tits on a bull, so, I won't use OVH again maybe ever.  They really do have the cheapest dedicated servers, and I wanted one to run REAL virtualization instead of LXC containers because at the time LXC was pissing me off also, but quite badly, as I was not able to get the containers to network and my steps to retrying were so lengthy I ran outta patience.  Well, waste begat waste because in the ambition for real virtualization was a huge waste also.  This is why I only as of now have a server again.  TooFast.vip (my XMPP chat server host) was down, this page was down, my flask project MusicPlace.vip was down, no public nothing since my budget for a server per month was wasted on OVH, and I emphasize WASTED.<br/><br/>
SUPRISE!!  Now I'm renting a VPS from some IRC friends.  The interface or management of it is lacklustre and entirely command line but now I've also found a way to make LXC containers friggin work.  With networking!  Did u know that libvirt has a package (in debian it's `<code>sudo apt install libvirt-daemon-driver-lxc</code>`) for managing LXC containers?  And if u ignore the Qemu aspect of libvirt (and virt-manager, etc) it can manage containers, and this scheme of brilliant software if I may say so myself, automagically makes LXC boxes run on <code>virbr0</code> which is libvirt's bridge for VMs.  More can be nmade with differing configurations though.  So, and I'm familiar with libvirt so YAY :D  On my laptop Debian I've succeeded at the new devops apparatus but in dev/test mode.  I know what to do, and some things I will run publicly will be used in LXC containers.  It's been a long time and I'm finally happy to say it's on the way!!!  Ahah, maybe somebody reading this is like "what, I don't see any boxes..." but that's because this is devops, it's on server side of my linux server, it's how the entire software abstracts correlate and network and work together so that the client can view my website, but me and my server are more secure being containerized, and replicable, if somebody fux up my WSGI server, I can just reiterate it, instead of the entire damn VPS server host itself.  It's reusable, more secure as it essentially fakes another operating system that is not supposed to have any knowledge it is a machine inside a machine.  The libvirt does all the management of software emulation and bricking off any sort of path traversal, chroot, jail, whatever stuff, if u know u know, if not, then at least be happy I made stuff more secure.  Or I'm working on it anyways ^^<br/><br/>
Here, lemme share with you a little art I made recently:<br/><br/>
<img src="/img/da.gif.gif" style="width: 168px; height: 68px; margin-left: 40px;" /><br/><br/>
I dunno if you've noticed but that's the background tile for this /blog page now.  Just random stuff ^^<br/><br/>
So in other news, I acquired another new Mini-ATX small form factor computer.  This one I was very very fortunate finding out just how powerful it is!  If you know what a mini-atx looks like, then you probably wouldn't suspect that it could have an additional graphics card added into it would ya...  Well this one has a PCI-E x8 and with a proprietary Lenovo made only riser card I can angle that to a x16 and THERE ACTUALLY IS some GPUs that fit and work just fine in this machine D:  >.....>>..>..<br/><br/>
I also found a huge write up about it, very detailed, maddest props to the guys that wrote that all out with all the references I needed to know how to turn my mini-atx into a legitimate gaming computer :D:D  That's cool!!<br/><br/>
Also I have gotten me a new laptop, a Lenovo X250 with a 12.5" diameter screen and a backlit keyboard :D:D  It's kewl.  Screw gaming laptops, they're shit, the bios/firmwares on gaming laptops is so easily corruptable, like the MSI and the alienware too i used to have pfff, but business class laptops are where it's at!  The security settings in Lenovo computers are GREAT.  AMAZING even.  So awesome, and they're always nice looking, feeling and running.  So I'm happy not being able to play NFS Unbound, for now.<br/><br/>
Oi, there'd be more news for this past month, but I will leave it at this.  I hope you enjoyed reading my stuff, and I will over the next time (given my stuff all stays stable) write more kkewl updates to the design of the8woodcutter.sh and lastly I do have some other post ideas, so stay tuned!  Get an RSS reader so you can get auto poppos on my shiz @_@<br/>

<p>
Greetings Internet People.  I thought I would write a post here now about new stuff that's happened-ning.<br/><br/>
So that music site project I was talking about in the last post, it's much nice now!  You can check it out here: <a href="https://musicplace.vip" target="_blank">MusicPlace.Vip</a>.  I kept the same theme of top level domain (the ".vip") as my other favorite domain name "TooFast.vip" (which is my main XMPP server host).  I originally thought of just using a subdomain, as "musicplace.toofast.vip", but was very attracted to the appearance of "MusicPlace.vip" and it was only about 7 dollars Canadian.  So over the winter holidays, xmas season, I been occasionally working on this flask application, in part to learn flask web application framework using python language, but also because I had a motivation and that was to be able to share music links on XMPP chats that are not rewritten filenames to some bullcrap non-human readable hash string, and are from a creative origin.  The idea was that if I'm playing my music in my VLC or Poweramp app while out and about and I find a cool track in my same collection, as on phone as on server, that instead of uploading the file as it is and it get renamed to aerjnoiub98eronbo.flac, I want that filename to show what the file is!  Sometimes people don't want to download crap that has no readable name, as well sometimes people want to keep their file they downloaded, so if I shared it it was for them to listen to sure, but the option to keep it is now successful because going through their files they'll find a file that's named a way they can know wtf it is.  Makes sense right?  But XMPP and some of the developers for client software and such have a different political idea of how HTTP upload file shares should work.  Not many people believe that uploads are away of sharing files, they're supposed to be inline images, or something really web 3.0 bullshit.  I find that XMPP is losing it's original web chat spirit because of these "phone fags" as some people would call them, that only think in their development and software progression like a phone user.  Sad, really, cuz I am oldschool about web stuff, and I found a lot of value in the way things used to be but see it actively unable to exist anymore.  I guess such is life.<br/><br/>
So "MusicPlace.vip" the file, or the "/musiclist", is locked by a super secret password, and at this time it is really only myself that gets to use that as I recently changed the passwd and probably will somewhat often.  I wanted also to be able to share my music files, which a lot of them are in fact paid for and HQ audio, but I didn't like it as an open public webserver directory as I'm not sure but I don't think that's legal, I really don't know becacuse I cannot digest terms + services legal jargon, who reads that stuff anyways?  NOBODY!  So but I may have heard it's not legal or something, I don't really believe that because as I said that the purpose is to share them the only available way to XMPP chat.  I did due diligence, and whatever.<br/><br/>
I am really stoked about the CSS (styles) though, it seems I've created a theme with it too because I've created a subdomain (another simpler flask project inside the musicplace project) that is my place to post a public prayer.  I follow the Christian faith.  I thought of this as a cool way to praise the Lord.  It also uses a similar almost same CSS theme, you can view that at <a href="https://prayers.musicplace.vip" target="_blank">prayers.musicplace.vip</a>.  <b>It is not finished yet</b>.<br/><br/>
Another thing, I suppose I wouldn't be proud of, is a bullshit saga going on that I'm making the most of with humour and no fucks given, is a saga where I was originally banished back to an XMPP group chat I thoroughly hate and in such banishment, which not a nice thing to do, I suppose I've seized the opportunity to shit all over that chat and do and say whatever the hell I want cuz <a href="../ufq.html" target="_blank">fuck you</a>.  That's because they all did an offence to me and already hate me and think bads things about me so I am indeed being a plague and don't care, you cannot nor will not be able to make me care.  LoL..  Stubborn, I know, but in my eyes it's worth the hilarity it causes sometimes and I should learn to care less about what internet people have to say, not in the way that it creates more problems for folks, just that I have been known to get offended.  People don't care to unnofffend me once offending me and I cry a lot because of this, and so, I am now perpetually full retard until enough of my JIDs are banned I feel successful.<br/><br/>
So yea, that's the happening today for recently.  I am enjoying flask, because I enjoy pythons, and the creative juices are a flowing!  If you want the password for the music app, only authorized people are allowed to ask me on XMPP as my JID is, you will have to figure that out.  I'm not giving it out publicly anymore.  So on this day it is good to be alive and thank God for all things provided, he is much our true captain and leader and rememberig Him is loving Him who loves us.  <code>pEAcE</code>

<b>Heya internet.  Whappens moew?</b><br/><br/>
<img src="/img/me.smmoke.w.specs.8.jpg" alt="I wear my sunglasses at winter..." /><br/><br/>
So this past 2 days has been gruelling, back breaking, barely withstandable labour to do a handful of things.  I am basically going to try to make a web community under the pirate flag of THE ARMADA, do not repeat that without using all capitals, out of respect for the fallen comrades, thanks, but in making this community again it requires a code place.  I mean a place to put the code, that we work on.  Fun part about gitea is it has communities for things like this.  When I first tried to make this community I also tried the google shit, that supposed business email, groups, etc shit, and I say shit because just like amazon I can't imagine how such a terrible corporation is s filthy rich..  Anyways.  So I thought this time I would make a mail server on my <code> Network Throughput I/O </code> domain <code>Packets.cc</code> ..  Anyways, and I found a thing, I haven't seen it yet, but in debian repositories <code>mailman3-web</code> (i think it was).  I guess it uses a thing called <code>HyperKitty</code> and Django for a web app that handles mail?  I'm willing to give it a try!<br/><br/>
As well, I'm not sure why I'm struggling to understand and deal with figuring out how the F to host a uWSGI, or any WSGI, server for proxying my https from my <b>FLASK PROJECT!!</b> 😄😄😄😄  Yes, I am VERY much happy that I am learning a new, and in my opinion possibly better than Laravel, web application framework.  I'm pretty sure very very few people know one thing about me, and that is that I really enjoy web applications and creating them gives me a helluva a good feeling when confronted with all the ideas I get for building web apps.  This is truly what I was destined to do I think but anyways, so, I'm really stoked about Flask, and Pythons!<br/><br/>
It is questionable whether the page is or will be operational, but <a href="https://musicplace.vip" target="_blank">MUSICPLACE.Vip</a> and JUST TODAY!  I managed to figure out how <code>uWSGI</code> works, at least enough that it's rendering the CSS files.  It's a work in progress though, and I'm not giving out the password until it's stable.  Afterwards I might ask a couple of folks if they want to poke it, meaning with a pen, just to know I build my flask app sturdy.<br/><br/>
I shall return for more EPIC POST!  GIT ER DRUNK, BAMBOOZLE HER, THEN PARTY AT MY POST!  LoL I just made that up, stupid, I know.<br/><br/>
<b>PLUS:</b> As for XMPP, which I fail to properly rage quit, and I am permanently a slave to, I discovered that one of my new years resolutions for 2024 will be that if I'm going to always be a strange and weird XMPP server operator, I might as well be better at it.  Blimey trolls!  OH AND ONE MORE THING: I shall be doing CSS/layout type modifications to the8woodcutter.sh, to make it actually worth visiting.  There's a slight chance that this intention gets lost in the abyss of my many missions but let's propose it happens, and you might love the changes when they come, bon voyage!  😵

<p>Lots of things are new.  I haven't added a post to this blog since, well, an eon has passed.  A LOT of stuff has happened.  I moved and been in an almost living hell.  I had my devices hacked to shit.  There was a not too distant time where every last windows or linux host I would set up was getting hacked.  There was some gangster shit going on, dunno what, nothing to do with me.  So my XMPP server (TooFast.vip) died as there was also some hackers there in that realm.  Another oddball thing that happened (I suspect from XMPP realm) is my phone got blacklisted.  A fully 100% legitimate phone, not stolen, and it got blacklisted not once but twice.  I was gonna buy a different one anyways so whatever.  Now I use it for music on my stereo.<br><br>
I've been studying Python language for a while and I'm really enjoying that.  Taking it slow and letting myself absorb it.  What I find gratifying is once in a while firing up a session of programming in Python with my lovely text editor.  I have a couple of projects I do with python and I even learned a little bit of Django, which is a web application framework using python.  I'm suprised as I found it to be quite similar to Laravel which I have used somewhat extensively.  It would be an easy framework to pick up having learned a web application framework a bunch already.  I've been also on SoloLearn, which btw I highly recommend for Android, and learning pythons.  Much to my enjoyment.  In fact it's the literal only social media I use.  Nobody knows about it basically but here's a link: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sololearn">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sololearn</a><br><br>
I shut off one of my vhosts (HardTeckno.com) because I am too lazy to deal with it right now and I'm almost certain nobody is viewing it right now.  There's also <a href="https://battlecruiser.co">☆ 𝕓Λ𝕥𝕥𝕃Є𝕜Я𝕦¡𝕫ЄЯ ☆</a> (battlecruiser.co) to look at if you like :)<br><br>
Other than that I am bored.  I'm doing the 'night shift' which means stay up all night, sleep all day.  For reasons that I can get some more studying done.  I can't say it's working necessarily all that well LoL..  As I tend to have ADD.  Such is in my old age I've developed, hey look a squirrel!  Summer is almost over and I've been quite enjoying riding my ol bike.  This winter I'll likely improve all my projects and get back to coding, if life settles down a bunch.  Shit is crazee sometimes, living in a hell hole place.  Bon Voyage!<br>
